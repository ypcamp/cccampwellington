        <div class="center"><div class="text"> The Campus Christians Camp is for students, young working ones, and seeking Christians
            to spend a three day weekend, the 29 August - 1 September 2019, to see and enjoy Christ in His Word in an environment that is
            free from busy schedules, anxieties of study and other distractions.
        Often times the Lord would take His disciples to a deserted place or a mountaintop far away from the crowds in order to
            unveil something deep and precious regarding Godâ€™s eternal purpose (e.g. <a href="https://online.recoveryversion.bible/BibleChapters.cfm?cid=17">Matthew 17:1</a>).
        <br>
        Camp registration due date was Friday 17th August 2018. Late registrations are still welcome but you may not get your preference.
Please register as soon as possible to help us with arrangements!
        <br>
        Proudly hosted by the Victoria University Christian Club.
